# Better Forms

This repository supports the "Better Forms with LiveView" conference talk at Gig
City Elixir 2023 (by Andrew Ek).

## Tests

You can run tests with `mix test` or `mix test.watch`.

## Analysis and All That

You can run `mix credo` to get lint output. It's pretty nice.

## Installation and Running

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix
  phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
